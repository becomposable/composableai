# Composable Prompts SDK

This is the JavaScript SDK for [Composable Prompts Studio](https://app.composableprompts.com).

The library provides a client to connect to the studio and the tools needed to manage prompts, interactions, and other studio objects. For a [complete documentation](https://docs.composableprompts.com/) of the Composable Prompts Studio, click here.

This README focuses on installation, basic usage, and interaction execution. We recommend using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) in your projects to leverage the SDK types and the interactions generated types.
